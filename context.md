we're building a multiplayer ski-ing slider game, where players slide on ice, and try to survive being pushed off the edge for rounds that last a few minutes. the palyer can also dash using space button to lung quickly in the direction they're facing to push other players on impact.

art style is top-down pixel art, the map will have the sliding ice area, and around it there will be water where if the player goes they fall off edge and freeze.

the movement is standard ice sliding, and controlled by players using right click with mouse. 

- since this is a multiplayer game, we'll need to use server-authorative approach to ensure secure gameplay.
